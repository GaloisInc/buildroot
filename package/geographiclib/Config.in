	  GeographicLib is a small set of C++ classes for performing conversions
          between geographic, UTM, UPS, MGRS, geocentric, and local cartesian
          coordinates, for gravity (e.g., EGM2008), geoid height, and
          geomagnetic field (e.g., WMM2010) calculations, and for solving
          geodesic problems.
